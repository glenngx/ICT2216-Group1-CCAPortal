# Co-Curricular Activities Portal (CCAP))

- **Students** to participate in important CCA decisions through secure, anonymous voting on matters such as scheduling and leadership selection
- **Moderators** (student leaders) to create polls, manage members, and collect feedback from their CCA community
- **Administrators** to oversee all CCAs, assign moderator roles, and maintain the integrity of the platform
